### Why are my dv results not consistent with their benchmark webpage?
because it slows down with consecutive runs, dropping to a quarter of initial performance.

ok 1 table.query.sum: 1000000x3
# 12.019 MFlops/sec ±16.51%  n = 15 µ = 83ms : [0.022,0.02225,0.0935,0.092,0.0925,0.0925,0.09325,0.092,0.093,0.09275,0.09275,0.09225,0.09275,0.092,0.0925]


### Can I make Frame as fast as dv by encoding the strings?
likely it will give a 3x speedup.

### Is the FrameIndex.reduce faster than dv.query, when Frame.groupby has already been run?
yes, but not quite faster than the ultra-fast first two runs of dv.query

### Can I make FrameIndex.reduce faster than the ultra-fast dv.query?

try:
1. reproducing results
2. removing the function call


### Is the dv setup longer?

### Why is dv faster initially?
